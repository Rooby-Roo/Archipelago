## Required software
1. Frogmonster, as available [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1853760/Frogmonster/).

## Choosing your Settings
Go to the [Frogmonster options page](/games/Frogmonster/player-options) and select the options that appeal to you. One you are satisfied with your choices, if you are playing alone, select `Generate Single-Player Game` at the bottom. If you are playing in a multiworld, instead select `Export Options` to download a .yaml file, and give that file to your room host. In either case, you will be given a link to your room page, which will have your connection information.

## Installing the Frogmonster client
The Frogmonster AP Client is currently developed by the main developer of Frogmonster, and is distributed as a Steam beta of the game. To access Frogmonster game betas, open your Steam library, right click on Frogmonster, click "Properties", and then click "Betas". You can select the randomizer client from the dropdown menu on this page. Once you've selected a beta, launch Frogmonster. Confirm that you've got the client set up by looking at the bottom left corner of the title screen. The version number should contain the text "RANDOMIZER". If it does, your client is set up.

If at any point you would like to go back to the original version of the game, open the Betas tab again and deselect the randomizer branch. Your original save files will still be preserved.

## Playing the game
In order to connect to your randomized game, start a new save file (or open a save file previously used during this run of the randomizer). Once you've opened a world, you will be presented with a dark screen as the game waits for you to connect to the world. Once you get to this screen, go the console window (that opened with Frogmonster) and run the /connect command as prompted. You will need the server name (most likely archipelago.gg), your port number (5 digits, which you can get from the room link), and your slot name (which is the play name you wrote in your options; you can also look at the room page if you don't remember it). If your server has a password set, you will need this as well.

A completed /connect command will look something like this: `/connect archipelago.gg:38281 FrogGamer`. Once you've entered that correctly, your game will start, and you can begin playing!
