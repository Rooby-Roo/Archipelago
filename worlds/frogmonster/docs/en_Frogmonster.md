## What does randomization do to the game?

By default, every single chest in the game, as well as every item given to you by NPCs and every boss reward is randomized. Additionally, each bug when eaten for the first time will give you a randomized item, and the ability to equip each bug is shuffled among these locations. Optionally, you can also include the assorted sliding tile puzzles, so their coin rewards are shuffled, and completing them gives an item.

## What's the goal of Frogmonster when randomized?

The goal is set in your settings. By default, you win the game by going to Myzand's Forest and defeating Myzand. Alternatively, you can set it up so that the goal condition is instead to collect the Eye Fragment, which is just behind the 6-Eye Door in Ridge.

## What does another world's item look like in Frogmonster?

Most models and text lines are unchanged from the baseline Frogmonster game, causing the items to look like their vanilla counterparts until checked. Once found, a pop-up in the top-right corner of the screen will indicate what item was found, and for what player. Please note that not all characters are able to be shown in the Frogmonster font, including numbers, so you may wish to look at the console, or have a text client open, in order to get the full picture.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

By default, all items will notify you when they are recieved by pushing a pop-up in the top right corner of the screen. Additionally, any guns sent will be equipped automatically. You can check your inventory screen in the pause menu at any time to see which items you have available to you.
